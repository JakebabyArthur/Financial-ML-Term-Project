# **ETF Term Project: The Future Technologies and Infrastructure ETF**

**Hongduo, SHAN**

---

## **Introduction**

This research is conducted to lay the groundwork for launching the **Future Technologies and Infrastructure ETF (FTI-ETF)**, which will focus on companies driving innovation in technology, AI, cloud computing, virtual asset, and supply chains, as well as including broad market indexes for stability and diversification. The goal is to provide investors with a product that balances exposure to high-growth sectors with stable market benchmarks.

**Potential users of this ETF include:**

* Retail investors seeking exposure to cutting-edge technology and infrastructure developments.
* Institutional investors are looking to diversify technology holdings through a systematic, actively managed ETF.
* Wealth management advisors are looking for structured technology-sector solutions for clients.
* Academics and students are interested in real-world examples of systematic ETF strategies in modern markets.

### **Target includes:**

* ETFs targeting technology and infrastructure trends are in high demand, but existing options often lack a balance of growth and stability.
* A rules-based strategy combining sector rotation, volatility targeting, and momentum works well in dynamic tech sectors.
* Existing ETFs (e.g., QQQ, ARK funds) inspire my approach but my ETF offers more diversification through supply chain stocks and indexes, which reduces sector concentration risk.
* Risk management through systematic rebalancing and diversification is critical in high-volatility sectors like AI and cloud computing.

## **Literature Review**

The research builds upon established work in portfolio theory, systematic investing, and ETF design. Key contributions include:

* Markowitz (1952, 1956) on portfolio optimization and the risk-return frontier.
* Sharpe (1963, 1994) on portfolio performance measurement and risk-adjusted returns.
* Graham (2006) and Siegel (2022) on disciplined, long-term investing.
* Grinold & Kahn (2023) on quantitative portfolio management, relevant for rule-based stock selection.
* Covel (2009, 2011, 2017) on systematic, trend-following strategies which influence my risk management approach.
* Patterson (2011, 2013) and Lewis (2015) on the rise of algorithmic trading and its relevance to ETF automation.
